I was saving my strawberries for today.  I was really looking foreword to it all week. But when I opened the container and they were fuzzy and beat up.  Definitely not fit for consumption.

Doing a quick Google search I found that white vinegar can kill spores that cause your delicious berries to turn to a gross fuzzy mush.

From [Momables](http://www.momables.com/how-to-keep-berries-fresher-longer/):

1. Once you bring your fresh berries home, the key to keeping it fresh is to kill any spores on the fruit.  The PH of vinegar does that job.

2. Place the berries in a large bowl and wash them in a vinegar-water bath:  1 cup of white vinegar and 3 cups of water.

3. Let the berries sit in the vinegar-water bath, gently moving them to help dislodge any dirt, grime and letting the vinegar kill spores and bacteria.
Drain the berries in a colander and then thoroughly rinse the fruit (to remove any vinegar flavor).

4. Thicker skinned fruit (like strawberries or blueberries) can be dried in a salad spinner but delicate berries such as raspberries and blackberries should be dried on a towel, patting them with paper or cloth towels.

5. Store the washed and dried fruit in a sealed container that has been lined with paper towels â€” if using an air-tight container, leave the lid slightly open to avoid natural moisture build-up.  When I handle fruit I have purchased from my grocery store, I wash the original container and then re-use it, making sure to line it with paper towels.

Fuck yeah!  Fresh berries and fruit forever.  And by forever I mean about a week.
