<img class="alignright" src="/images/th/new-job.jpg">Well, I got my self a new job. For those who don’t already know I’m working at the Disneyland Resort as a dishwasher. Very glamorous.

I actually made a video that I’ve been trying to post (and you thought I forgot about you) but a 260MB video is a little bit big to upload without taking some time. I’ve been tethering to my MetroPCS unlimited plan for internet access but the upload speeds are a bit slow in this part of the house and the laptop doesn’t have a battery.

**So to recap**: I haven’t forgotten about you. Just busy being awesome.
