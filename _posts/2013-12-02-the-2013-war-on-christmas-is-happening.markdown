<img class="alignright" src="/images/itshappening.gif">I love the whole Thanksgiving/Christmas/New Years thing.  It’s an excuse to take much needed time with my family and friends (Providing I’m not working of course).  There is a tradition that I started a few years back and I encourage everyone to join it.  Every year I get all snug and comfy in front of my computer (AMDs sure do get warm) and embark on a quest to find the dumbest “War on Christmas” articles I can.  Already this year has not let me down.

[Patheos.com Has some of the best](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/11/09/sarah-palin-an-angry-atheist-with-a-lawyer-is-one-of-the-most-powerful-persons-in-america/):

> “I bet Charles Darwin never understood this: If the world could be described as truly survival-of-the-fittest, why would people collectively be stricken with the spirit of generosity in December?”

> “The war on Christmas is the tip of the spear in a larger battle to secularize our culture, and make true religious freedom a thing of America’s past.”

As you can imagine these were so good I almost squeeled like a christmas pig.  I’m going to keep an eye out for more gems.
