<img class="alignright" width="300" src="/images/bike-rack.jpg">I live in a bicycle friendly city. It’s one of the reasons I moved back to Long Beach. I’ve recently gave up driving and now my transportation is predominately bicycle. For distances further than I’d like to ride or days where the weather is too brutal (rare as that is) Long Beach has a really good public transportation system.

There is a really good program for city funded bicycle racks. The great part of this program is that it help the cities local infrastructure with minimal expense to the local business owners. The down side is that not every business takes advantage of this program.

As you can see from the attached photo, some of these bike racks are quite inventive. As a caring cyclist in the city I guess it should be on me to try and convince local business that I fequent to sign up for the rack program. Anything that I add can only improve the infrastructure.
