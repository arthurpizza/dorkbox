I don’t mind the default website quick dial that shows up in Firefox when you make a new tab. However having my favorite search page is a lot nicer. Here’s how to set a custom URL for new tabs in Firefox.

To change the new tab URL type **about:config** in the address bar. You’ll probably be prompted with a warning unless you’ve already disabled it. search for **browser.newtab.url** and change the Value to any website you like. Enjoy!
