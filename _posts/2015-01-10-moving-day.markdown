It’s moving day and it’s the first rainy day of 2015. Only got two boxes moved with help from my friend Johnstar.

Moving is not stressful for me. I actually like the fact that I’ve condensed my belongings to such a minimal set. Removing the clutter and making room and time for things that matter.

I’ll be here for the next four months. Just a sublease to save some cash and get my bills paid off and squared away.

Happy January and enjoy the rain!
