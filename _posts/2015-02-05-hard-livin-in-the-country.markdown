Howdy!

Yeah, I know about hard county livin’.

*Spits*

In fact, I just spend damn near 24 hours in the meanest most manly parts of Centeral California… Visiting my girlfriends mom.

*Mosey*

Tellyouwhat! That’s hard county livin’. How hard?

__Electric stove hard.__

You city slickers don’t know how good you have it. Have you ever tried to make an omelet on an electric stove? I haven’t but I hear it’s hard.

*Spits, Tips hat, Mosey*

It was even too cold to hop in the hot tub cause of the low 60° temperature in the morning. Getting online? Forget it, all they have out there is AT&T. I could hardly update my Twitter. Now that’s hard livin’!

Well there you have it.

*Spits, Tips hat, Mosey, Hard liquor for lunch*

I know know what hardcore cowboys have to go through every day.

*Rides off into the sunset*
