I find it hard to write. I should be writing a lot more. Everyone should. It clears the mind and some have claimed it does more than yoga or [meditation]. So why is it so damn hard to take 30 minutes to do some basic writing? Just like working out, once you get started you'll feel more into it. I workout 3-5 times a week depending on my schedule. I should also be writing. (Too bad I can't write while working out.)

I keep a simple word processor on all my devices. Got one on my computer, laptop, tablet, and even my phone. Any time I got an idea while I'm on the bus or wherever I just let it flow out. Recently it's not been finding it's way onto this blog but the creative juices are definitely flowing more often. Even this post is much easier for me to pour out because of it.

There are a few things I should be doing that I don't do:

* I don't schedule time in my week for writing.
* I don't read enough. (I only read two books in all of 2014)
* I have a brand new (2010) AP Style Guide that I haven't picked since I got it.

The rule I need to remember, just like anything else in the creative world. A terrible completed piece is better than a incomplete masterpiece. Write as much as you can. Practice make perfect as they say. Keep writing.
