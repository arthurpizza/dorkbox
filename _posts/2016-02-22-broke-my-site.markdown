I feel rather dumb. When the Jekyll 3.0 update on Github happened, Like a long time ago, it somehow broke my theme. I couldn't update.

The worst part about it is the fact that I had no idea it was broken.

### DERP

I've been developing a new custom Jekyll theme that I will both be publishing as an open source project and as my new website theme. It's not ready. So until then I'll be rocking the default.

_Now back to our regularly scheduled blogspam._
