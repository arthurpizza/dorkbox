I recently got my old drawing tablet to work and I've been playing with the program [MyPaint]. After a few night of trial and error on my Manjaro Linux box I've figured out how to get decent artwork out of it. The hardest part was simply wrapping my brain around looking at the screen while I draw in my lap. That's not the way a lot of my muscle memory works.

I'm going to try and get more artwork up. It's a part of my creativity that I've let sit for far too long.
