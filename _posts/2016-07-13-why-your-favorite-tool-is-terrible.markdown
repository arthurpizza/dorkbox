I know a lot of user really like X but I'm here to tell you why X is just so terrible. I'm not saying you're a terrible person for liking X, but I simply cannot understand why any sane person would use X when Y exists.

What most people don't know is that the creator of Y was just so frustrated with X that he actually built Y as a replacement and it only took him a week to reproduce the main functionality of X.

Don't even get me started on the total lack of support for Z. I know you might not use Z, but for those who do it's absolutely imperative that Z support is included. By default.

In conclusion, X is terrible and everyone should use Y because it's better.
