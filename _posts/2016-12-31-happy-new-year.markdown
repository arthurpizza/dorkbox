Well the never ending dumpster fire known as **2016** has finally suffered the cardiac arrest that has claimed so many celebrities this year. It's finally over. Though, let's be frank here. The calender has nothing to do with it.

### Fuck it, Happy New Year Anyways.

Seriously, I do look forward to working to make 2017 a better year. I plan on not only being healthier and more socially responsible but also I want to help protect those who under this current sea of change might become jeopardized.
