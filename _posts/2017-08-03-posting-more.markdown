I really want to start posting more often on this site. I've probably have work things like this in the past but I really need to build up my writing skills.

I'm going to use this opportunity to lay out best practices when it comes to building tech related content.

**Building the Story**

1. **Status Quo** - Explain how the platform exists now and maybe point out some limitations. This helps the perspective of the novice user know what your target audience already knows.
2. **The Presentation** - Now that the audience is all warmed up it's time to wow them with our now innovation or solution.
3. **Wrap up** - Now we can bring bullet points on how this helps remedy the issues presented in section 1. Using literal bullet points is totally acceptable​.
4. **Citations** - Unless this was completely​ homegrown make sure to cite where the viewer can get more information to cover anything that was left out.

**Bonus** - After the release of the content into your platform make yourself available to connect with your audience.

I wrote this a few weeks ago but I have yet to follow-up when it comes to my comment.

## Seriously, I need to do better

I know my actual readership is very small. I'm leaving this as a message to myself. If anyone wants to keep me in check feel free to bug me on [Socal media] (/about/).
