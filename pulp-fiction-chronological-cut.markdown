![](/images/pulp-fiction.jpg){:.alignright width="360"} Five years ago I was watching Pulp Fiction with my friends and someone mentions that the story was hard to follow. I made the joke that I should re-edit the film into chronological order to make the story more coherent.

In November of 2010, Torrentfreak.com released [an article about record breaking torrent files](http://torrentfreak.com/5-torrent-files-that-broke-mind-boggling-records-101107/). On the list was the oldest torrent known to be still active: [The.Matrix-ASCII](http://onyx.chattanoogastate.edu/~jack/matrix/).

I started to think about what it was that they were doing. Like my film, this film was a classic example of fair use.  I have created a new work based on the work of Quentin Tarantino.

Armed with the original DVD, mencoder converted the film to a xvid/ac3 high resolution encoding. Kdenlive preserved the 5.1 surround sound during editing and when I was done, I had another high resolution xvid/ac3. Using Avidemux, Kdenlive, The GIMP, Handbrake, and FFMPEG the film has been re-encoded to a Xvid for everyone to download.
